# HARDWARE_TIMERS_AVERAGE_TASK
A FreeRTOS-based project on ESP32 that collects random values every second, calculates their average, and allows user interaction via Serial Monitor. It showcases real-time data processing, task synchronization, and hardware timer utilization, demonstrating my skills in embedded systems and multitasking.
